    "a) What are some reasons to prefer training our tokenizer on UTF-8 encoded bytes, rather than UTF-16 or UTF-32? It may be helpful to compare the output of these encodings for various input strings\n",
    "\n",
    "UTF-8 is often preferred for training tokenizers for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Space Efficiency**: UTF-8 uses a variable-length encoding scheme, where common characters (like ASCII) are represented with one byte, while less common characters use more bytes. This makes it more space-efficient for texts that primarily consist of ASCII characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compatibility**: UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII, meaning that any valid ASCII text is also valid UTF-8 text. This compatibility makes it easier to work with existing systems and libraries that expect ASCII input.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Widespread Adoption**: UTF-8 is the most widely used encoding on the web and in many programming languages, making it easier to find libraries and tools that support it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simplicity**: UTF-8's variable-length encoding allows for efficient processing of text, as it can handle a wide range of characters without requiring additional complexity in handling fixed-width encodings like UTF-16 or UTF-32.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Avoiding BOM**: UTF-16 and UTF-32 often include a Byte Order Mark (BOM) to indicate endianness, which can complicate text processing. UTF-8 does not require a BOM, simplifying the handling of text files.\n"

( window &gt; PSD Import ) You &apos;ll instantly see thumbnails of the layers along with their names .\\nfor example , you &apos;ve created a layer in Photoshop to give your image an antiqued look , but when you put it in your layout it seems swamped by the surrounding colors . one option might be to reduce the opacity of that layer by clicking on it and entering a new opacity level .\\nif you want to add an extra ink or plate to your images , you can set up a channel to do that in Photoshop . for example , maybe you intend to varnish part of an image , or you want to use a spot color within your image .\\nQuarkXPress can re \\xad map any channel right in the PSD Import palette - non \\xad destructively .\\nso click on the channels divider of the PSD Import Palette ; double click on the channel in question , and you can pick any color from your project &apos;s color palette , ensuring consistency .\\nas powerful as the PSD support of QuarkXPress 8 is , it can &apos;t manipulate certain kinds of layers , such as layer effects &#91; e.g.\\nif you use one of these layers , the image will import and print just fine , but you won &apos;t get access to the layer controls of the PSD Import palette .\\nif you need that functionality , you can eliminate those kinds of layers from your PSD by converting the layer effects to stand @-@ alone layers or &apos; smart objects &apos; &#91; right click on the Layer in the Photoshop layers palette &#93; .\\nQuarkXPress supports text layers , most adjustment layers , and even 3D layers including opacity and blending mode controls .\\nIllustrator is a great tool for creating logos and vector illustrations .\\ntraditionally , the route into QuarkXPress has been to export an EPS from Illustrator .\\nnow , things are made much easier with the arrival of direct Illustrator .ai file import into QuarkXPress 8 .\\nsimply drag and drop or import your Illustrator native file into your layout just as you would any graphics file format .\\nQuarkXPress has a powerful transparency engine , but it doesn &apos;t support partially transparent objects in PDF or .ai files yet .\\nso if you are using something like a drop shadow in Illustrator and plan to place that over a non @-@ white background or object , you might see undesirable results .\\nthe good news is that the drop shadow and transparency features of QuarkXPress works on imported Illustrator files , so you can apply a drop shadow or change the opacity of your .ai file right in your layout instead .\\nQuarkXPress is well equipped for drawing tasks and in our newest release we have standardised many of our graphics tools to work more like Illustrator , Freehand and similar tools .\\nwatch a video on how to create compelling illustrations in QuarkXPress 8 .\\npage @-@ layout professionals can create rich Flash projects - without compromising design - using the built @-@ in Flash authoring capabilities included in every edition of QuarkXPress 8 .\\nworking in the same familiar print environment of QuarkXPress 8 , you can take existing print jobs to Flash , or create new Flash projects , in minutes - no additional purchase or coding required !\\nwatch a video on how to create sophisticated Flash designs in QuarkXPress 8 .\\n* InDesign CS 4 : interactive elements such as hyperlinks , page transitions , and button actions are not included in the XFL file .\\ndisclaimer : this document is based on publicly available information and not based on hands @-@ on software evaluation .\\nits content may be revised at any time .\\nQuark Inc. accepts no responsibility legal or otherwise for the accuracy of this content .\\nQuarkXPress includes Web layouts that can create menus and hyperlinks , convert print graphics or fancy text treatments to Web graphics , and then write a standards @-@ based HTML file with CSS that can be opened directly in Adobe Dreamweaver .\\nQuarkXPress 8 can import PDF files up to version 1.7 ( the default PDF version from the Creative Suite applications when using the Press Quality PDF setting is PDF 1.4 .\\n&quot;

enemy . &quot;\\nthis proved to be pretty naive , since Gilad is much too nice to be called an &quot; enemy . &quot;\\nbut there we were : a Swede , a South African and an Israeli , all with very different professional background and life stories , talking about the future of families online from very different perspectives .\\nI didn &apos;t expect this , but we found that we had much in common .\\nwe shared the same ideas and vision for what we wanted to achieve with our businesses , even though our approach was far from similar .\\nKindo had set out to build a site that would help you interact with the family that is around you here and now .\\nwe were trying to come up with tools to help you share information and communicate with the people that matter most to you right now .\\nMyHeritage on the other hand had developed amazing technologies to help you find out everything about your family &apos;s history , and had spent years perfecting these technologies .\\nultimately though , what interested us both was the opportunity to help families discover more about who they are and their past , and use the web to bring them closer together .\\nas Gareth and I travelled back on the tube , we talked about how nice it would be to be able to offer our own users the same tools as MyHeritage already had .\\nwhat really got us excited was their SmartMatching Technology , which matches people in your family tree with 250 Million other names , and suggests who you might be related too .\\nduring this summer , we &apos;ve been thinking long and hard about the future of Kindo , and what the best option would be for taking Kindo to the next level .\\nthe more time we spent with Gilad as well as the rest of the team in Israel ( not to mention the very loud rooster that runs around in their campus ) , the more convinced we all became - we &apos;ll be better off together .\\nso we join the MyHeritage family because we share the same vision and values ( as families should ) , and because we think that we can build an amazing product together - bringing real benefits to families around the world .\\nthis is what we &apos;re planning to do over the next years .\\nas you see from the smiles in the picture below , this is a happy day for us here in the Putney Offices .\\nthis years Swedish Genealogy Days the yearly conference of the Swedish Federation of Genealogical Societies was held in the city of Malmö in the province of Skåne in southern Sweden .\\nover 100 exibitors crowded in the convention center at Europaporten in Malmö . everything from genealogical societies , archives to companies offering original sources online .\\nin the meanwhile , you can still work on your profiles and upload the photos from the weekend &apos;s family reunion .\\nupdate : now everything is fixed ! it was the database acting a bit weird but Stephen has done a great job to fix it .\\neveryone hits a brick wall in genealogy , where the birth and death records just aren &apos;t easy to find . in that case , try some different records .\\ndeeds often contain information on who sold what to whom ; who inherited what from whom ; or how some land was divided among a family . historic tax records on land also sometimes have interesting information , such as co @-@ ownership .\\njust as the squirrels and different kinds of birds collect nuts and seeds , someone in the Kindo office seems to be doing some really solid forward planning .\\njudging from this picture - it &apos;s going to be a looong winter .\\nas I point out in my book , Genealogy Online 8th Edition , you can do a lot of good research using search engines and Boolean operators ( AND , NOT , OR , and parentheses . ) Recently , Yahoo !\\nadvanced Google still accepts the most popular Boolean terms , and Exalead even supports the NEAR operator , which really helps with common surnames , but Live Search is now the only major search engine with full Boolean support .\\nfor more details on how to do the Boolean Boogie for genealogy , read Genealogy Online 8th Edition .\\nmost beginners to genealogy are fuzzy about cousinship . for example , while many understand first cousins are people with common grandparents , many folks confuse first cousin once removed and second cousin .\\nthen , there are families like mine : my mother &apos;s siblings were born from 1911 to 1932 . that means her youngest brother &quot; Mike &quot; went to school with the oldest sister &apos;s oldest child , his niece &quot; Karen . &quot;\\nas it turned out , Uncle &quot; Mike &quot; and niece &quot; Karen &quot; married two people who were siblings , &quot; Michelle &quot; and &quot; Kevin , &quot; making their children both first cousins and first cousins once removed .\\nshowing degrees of relationship by blood .\\n-first it does not replace paper documentation since it does not name common ancestors , it is more a tool to prove lineage .\\nseveral companies , like Family Tree DNA , can assist you to confirm your family tree or allow you to determine whether two people are related if you give them DNA of someone .\\n- It &apos;s less reffective for females to use DNA than for males because thanks to Y @-@ DNA , we can determine paternal and maternal lines , whereas for females it is just maternal .\\nhere are a few suggestions to get you started : introduction to Genealogy from National Genealogical Society ( U.S. ) Most genealogists take this course first . it is very American @-@ centric , but the techniques can be applied to any country &apos;s vital statistics .\\nmembers of the National Genealogical Society ( NGS ) receive a tuition discount . family History Personal Enrichment Classes Learn from Brigham Young University about research in the United States , France and Germany .\\nLufthansa owes its origins to &quot;

and had we remained in Jerusalem we should also have e perished .\\n5 But , said he , notwithstanding our afflictions , we have obtained a a land of promise , a land which is b choice above all other lands ; a land which the Lord God hath c covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed .\\nyea , the Lord hath d covenanted this land unto me , and to my children forever , and also all those who should be e led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord .\\n6 Wherefore , I , Lehi , prophesy according to the workings of the Spirit which is in me , that there shall a none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord .\\n7 Wherefore , this a land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring .\\nand if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given , it shall be a land of b liberty unto them ; wherefore , they shall never be brought down into captivity ; if so , it shall be because of iniquity ; for if iniquity shall abound c cursed shall be the land for their sakes , but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever .\\n8 And behold , it is wisdom that this land should be a kept as yet from the knowledge of other b nations ; for behold , many nations would overrun the land , that there would be no place for an inheritance .\\n9 Wherefore , I , Lehi , have obtained a a promise , that b inasmuch as those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his commandments , they shall c prosper upon the face of this land ; and they shall be kept from all other nations , that they may possess this land unto themselves .\\nand if it so be that they shall d keep his commandments they shall be blessed upon the face of this land , and there shall be none to molest them , nor to take away the land of their e inheritance ; and they shall dwell safely forever .\\n11 Yea , he will bring a other nations unto them , and he will give unto them power , and he will take away from them the lands of their possessions , and he will cause them to be b scattered and smitten .\\n12 Yea , as one generation passeth to another there shall be a bloodsheds , and great visitations among them ; wherefore , my sons , I would that ye would remember ; yea , I would that ye would hearken unto my words .\\n13 O that ye would awake ; awake from a deep a sleep , yea , even from the sleep of b hell , and shake off the awful c chains by which ye are bound , which are the chains which bind the children of men , that they are carried away captive down to the eternal d gulf of misery and woe .\\nand arise from the dust , and hear the words of a trembling a parent , whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold and silent b grave , from whence no traveler can c return ; a few more d days and I go the e way of all the earth .\\n15 But behold , the Lord hath a redeemed my soul from hell ; I have beheld his b glory , and I am encircled about eternally in the c arms of his d love .\\n16 And I desire that ye should remember to observe the a statutes and the judgments of the Lord ; behold , this hath been the anxiety of my soul from the beginning .\\n18 Or , that a a cursing should come upon you for the space of b many generations ; and ye are visited by sword , and by famine , and are hated , and are led according to the will and captivity of the c devil .\\n19 O my sons , that these things might not come upon you , but that ye might be a choice and a a favored people of the Lord .\\nbut behold , his will be done ; for his b ways are righteousness forever .\\n20 And he hath said that : a Inasmuch as ye shall keep my b commandments ye shall c prosper in the land ; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence .\\n22 That ye may not be a cursed with a sore cursing ; and also , that ye may not incur the displeasure of a b just God upon you , unto the destruction , yea , the eternal destruction of both soul and body .\\n23 Awake , my sons ; put on the armor of a righteousness .\\nshake off the b chains with which ye are bound , and come forth out of obscurity , and arise from the dust .\\n25 And I exceedingly fear and tremble because of you , lest he shall suffer again ; for behold , ye have a accused him that he sought power and b authority over you ; but I know that he hath not sought for power nor authority over you , but he hath sought the glory of God , and your own eternal welfare .\\n26 And ye have murmured because he hath been plain unto you .\\nye say that he hath used a sharpness ; ye say that he hath been angry with you ; but behold , his b sharpness was the sharpness of the power of the word of God , which was in him ; and that which ye call anger was the truth , according to that which is in God , which he could not restrain , manifesting boldly concerning your iniquities .\\n27 And it must needs be that the a power of God must be with him , even unto his commanding you that ye must obey .\\nbut behold , it was not he , but it was the b Spirit of the Lord which was in him , which c opened his mouth to utterance that he could not shut it .\\n28 And now my son , Laman , and also Lemuel and Sam , and also my sons who are the sons of Ishmael , behold , if ye will hearken unto the voice of Nephi ye shall not perish .\\nand if ye will hearken unto him I leave unto you a a blessing , yea , even my first blessing .\\n29 But if ye will not hearken unto him I take away my a first blessing , yea , even my blessing , and it shall rest upon him .\\n30 And now , Zoram , I speak unto you : behold , thou art the a servant of Laban ; nevertheless , thou hast been brought out of the land of Jerusalem , and I know that thou art a true b friend unto my son , Nephi , forever .\\n31 Wherefore , because thou hast been faithful thy seed shall be blessed a with his seed , that they dwell in prosperity long upon the face of this land ; and nothing , save it shall be iniquity among them , shall harm or disturb their prosperity upon the face of this land forever .\\n32 Wherefore , if ye shall keep the commandments of the Lord , the Lord hath consecrated this land for the security of thy seed with the seed of my son .\\nredemption cometh through the Holy Messiah - Freedom of choice ( agency ) is essential to existence and progression - Adam fell that men might be - Men are free to choose liberty and eternal life .\\n1 And now , Jacob , I speak unto you : thou art my a first -born in the days of my tribulation in the wilderness .\\nand behold , in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow , because of the rudeness of thy brethren .\\n2 Nevertheless , Jacob , my first @-@ born in the wilderness , thou knowest the greatness of God ; and he shall consecrate thine a afflictions for thy gain .\\n3 Wherefore , thy soul shall be blessed , and thou shalt dwell safely with thy brother , Nephi ; and thy days shall be a spent in the service of thy God .\\nWherefore , I know that thou art redeemed , because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer ; for thou hast b beheld that in the c fulness of time he cometh to bring salvation unto men .\\n4 And thou hast a beheld in thy youth his glory ; wherefore , thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh ; for the Spirit is the same , yesterday , today , and forever .\\nand the way is prepared from the fall of man , and b salvation is c free .\\n5 And men are instructed sufficiently that they a know good from evil .\\nand the b law is given unto men .\\nand by the law no flesh is c justified ; or , by the law men are d cut off .\\nyea , by the temporal law they were cut off ; and also , by the spiritual law they perish from that which is good , and become miserable forever .\\n6 Wherefore , a redemption cometh in and through the b Holy c Messiah ; for he is full of d grace and truth .\\n7 Behold , he offereth himself a a sacrifice for sin , to answer the ends of the law , unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit ; and unto b none else can the c ends of the law be answered .\\n9 Wherefore , he is the firstfruits unto God , inasmuch as he shall make a intercession for all the children of men ; and they that believe in him shall be saved .\\n10 And because of the intercession for a all , all men come unto God ; wherefore , they stand in the presence of him , to be b judged of him according to the truth and c holiness which is in him .\\n11 For it must needs be , that there is an a opposition in all things .\\nif not so , my first @-@ born in the wilderness , righteousness could not be brought to pass , neither wickedness , neither holiness nor misery , neither good nor bad .\\nWherefore , all things must needs be a compound in one ; wherefore , if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead , having no life neither death , nor corruption nor incorruption , happiness nor misery , neither sense nor insensibility .\\n12 Wherefore , it must needs have been created for a thing of naught ; wherefore there would have been no a purpose in the end of its creation .\\nWherefore , this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes , and also the power , and the mercy , and the b justice of God .\\n13 And if ye shall say there is a no law , ye shall also say there is no sin .\\nif ye shall say there is no sin , ye shall also say there is no righteousness .\\nand if there be no righteousness there be no happiness .\\nand if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery .\\nand if these things are not b there is no God .\\nand if there is no God we are not , neither the earth ; for there could have been no creation of things , neither to act nor to be acted upon ; wherefore , all things must have vanished away .\\n14 And now , my sons , I speak unto you these things for your profit and a learning ; for there is a God , and he hath b created all things , both the heavens and the earth , and all things that in them are , both things to act and things to be c acted upon .\\n16 Wherefore , the Lord God gave unto man that he should a act for himself .\\nWherefore , man could not b act for himself save it should be that he was c enticed by the one or the other .\\n17 And I , Lehi , according to the things which I have read , must needs suppose that an a angel of God , according to that which is written , had b fallen from heaven ; wherefore , he became a c devil , having sought that which was evil before God .\\n18 And because he had fallen from heaven , and had become miserable forever , he a sought also the misery of all mankind .\\nWherefore , he said unto Eve , yea , even that old serpent , who is the devil , who is the father of all b lies , wherefore he said : partake of the forbidden fruit , and ye shall not die , but ye shall be as God , c knowing good and evil .\\n19 And after Adam and Eve had a partaken of the forbidden fruit they were driven out of the garden of b Eden , to till the earth .\\n20 And they have brought forth children ; yea , even the a family of all the earth .\\n21 And the days of the children of a men were prolonged , according to the b will of God , that they might c repent while in the flesh ; wherefore , their state became a state of d probation , and their time was lengthened , according to the commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men .\\nfor he gave commandment that all men must repent ; for he showed unto all men that they were e lost , because of the transgression of their parents .\\n22 And now , behold , if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen , but he would have remained in the garden of Eden .\\nand all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created ; and they must have remained forever , and had no end .\\n23 And they would have had no a children ; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence , having no b joy , for they knew no misery ; doing no good , for they knew no c sin .\\n24 But behold , all things have been done in the wisdom of him who a knoweth all things .\\n25 a Adam b fell that men might be ; and men c are , that they might have d joy .\\n26 And the a Messiah cometh in the fulness of time , that he may b redeem the children of men from the fall .\\nand because that they are c redeemed from the fall they have become d free forever , knowing good from evil ; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon , save it be by the punishment of the e law at the great and last day , according to the commandments which God hath given .\\n27 Wherefore , men are a free according to the b flesh ; and c all things are d given them which are expedient unto man .\\nand they are free to e choose f liberty and eternal g life , through the great Mediator of all men , or to choose captivity and death , according to the captivity and power of the devil ; for he seeketh that all men might be h miserable like unto himself .\\n29 And not choose eternal death , according to the will of the flesh and the a evil which is therein , which giveth the spirit of the devil power to b captivate , to bring you down to c hell , that he may reign over you in his own kingdom .\\n30 I have spoken these few words unto you all , my sons , in the last days of my probation ; and I have chosen the good part , according to the words of the prophet .\\nand I have none other object save it be the everlasting a welfare of your souls .\\nthe Gods finish their planning of the creation of all things - They bring to pass the creation according to their plans - Adam names every living creature .\\n1 And thus we will finish the heavens and the earth , and all the a hosts of them .\\n2 And the Gods said among themselves : on the seventh time we will end our work , which we have counseled ; and we will a rest on the b seventh time from all our work which we have counseled .\\n3 And the Gods concluded upon the seventh time , because that on the seventh time they would a rest from all their b works which they ( the Gods ) counseled among themselves to form ; and c sanctified it .\\nand thus were their decisions at the time that they counseled among themselves to form the heavens and the earth .\\n5 According to all that which they had said concerning every plant of the field before it was in the a earth , and every herb of the field before it grew ; for the Gods had not caused it to rain upon the earth when they counseled to do them , and had not formed a man to till the ground .\\n6 But there went up a mist from the earth , and watered the whole face of the ground .\\n7 And the a Gods formed man from the b dust of the ground , and took his c spirit ( that is , the man &apos;s spirit ) , and put it into him ; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life , and man became a living d soul .\\n8 And the Gods planted a garden , eastward in a Eden , and there they put the man , whose spirit they had put into the body which they had formed .\\n9 And out of the ground made the Gods to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food ; the a tree of life , also , in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and evil .\\n10 There was a river running out of Eden , to water the garden , and from thence it was parted and became into four heads .\\n11 And the Gods took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden , to dress it and to keep it .\\n13 But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it ; for in the time that thou eatest thereof , thou shalt surely die .\\nnow I , Abraham , saw that it was after the Lord &apos;s a time , which was after the time of b Kolob ; for as yet the Gods had not appointed unto Adam his reckoning .\\n14 And the Gods said : let us make an help meet for the man , for it is not good that the man should be alone , therefore we will form an help meet for him .\\n16 And of the rib which the Gods had taken from man , formed they a a woman , and brought her unto the man .\\n18 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall a cleave unto his wife , and they shall be b one flesh .\\n19 And they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not a ashamed .\\n20 And out of the ground the Gods formed every beast of the field , and every fowl of the air , and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them ; and whatsoever a Adam called every living creature , that should be the name thereof .\\n21 And Adam gave a names to all b cattle , to the fowl of the air , to every beast of the field ; and for Adam , there was found an c help meet for him .\\nmen are called as high priests because of their exceeding faith and good works - They are to teach the commandments - Through righteousness they are sanctified and enter into the rest of the Lord - Melchizedek was one of these - Angels are declaring glad tidings throughout the land - They will reveal the actual coming of Christ .\\n1 And again , my brethren , I would cite your minds forward to the time when the Lord God gave these commandments unto his children ; and I would that ye should remember that the Lord God a ordained priests , after his holy order , which was after the order of his Son , to teach these things unto the people .\\n2 And those priests were ordained after the a order of his Son , in a b manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for redemption .\\n4 And thus they have been a called to this holy calling on account of their faith , while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and b blindness of their minds , while , if it had not been for this they might have had as great c privilege as their brethren .\\n9 Thus they become a high priests forever , after the order of the Son , the Only Begotten of the Father , who is without beginning of days or end of years , who is full of b grace , equity , and truth .\\n11 Therefore they were called after this holy order , and were a sanctified , and their b garments were washed white through the blood of the Lamb .\\n12 Now they , after being a sanctified by the b Holy Ghost , having their garments made white , being c pure and spotless before God , could not look upon d sin save it were with e abhorrence ; and there were many , exceedingly great many , who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God .\\n13 And now , my brethren , I would that ye should humble yourselves before God , and bring forth a fruit meet for repentance , that ye may also enter into that rest .\\n14 Yea , humble yourselves even as the people in the days of a Melchizedek , who was also a high priest after this same order which I have spoken , who also took upon him the high priesthood forever .\\n15 And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid a tithes ; yea , even our father Abraham paid tithes of one @-@ tenth part of all he possessed .\\n16 Now these a ordinances were given after this b manner , that thereby the people might look forward on the Son of God , it being a c type of his order , or it being his order , and this that they might look forward to him for a remission of their sins , that they might enter into the rest of the Lord .\\n18 But Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith , and received the office of the high priesthood according to the a holy order of God , did preach repentance unto his people .\\nand behold , they did repent ; and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his days ; therefore he was called the prince of peace , for he was the king of Salem ; and he did reign under his father .\\n19 Now , there were a many before him , and also there were many afterwards , but b none were greater ; therefore , of him they have more particularly made mention .\\n20 Now I need not rehearse the matter ; what I have said may suffice .\\nbehold , the a scriptures are before you ; if ye will b wrest them it shall be to your own destruction .\\n22 Yea , and the voice of the Lord , by the a mouth of angels , doth declare it unto all nations ; yea , doth declare it , that they may have glad tidings of great joy ; yea , and he doth sound these glad tidings among all his people , yea , even to them that are scattered abroad upon the face of the earth ; wherefore they have come unto us .\\n23 And they are made known unto us in a plain terms , that we may understand , that we cannot err ; and this because of our being b wanderers in a strange land ; therefore , we are thus highly favored , for we have these glad tidings declared unto us in all parts of our vineyard .\\n24 For behold , a angels are declaring it unto many at this time in our land ; and this is for the purpose of preparing the hearts of the children of men to receive his word at the time of his coming in his glory .\\n25 And now we only wait to hear the joyful news declared unto us by the mouth of angels , of his coming ; for the time cometh , we a know not how soon .\\nwould to God that it might be in my day ; but let it be sooner or later , in it I will rejoice .\\n26 And it shall be made known unto a just and holy men , by the mouth of angels , at the time of his coming , that the words of our fathers may be fulfilled , according to that which they have spoken concerning him , which was according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them .\\n29 a Having faith on the Lord ; having a hope that ye shall receive eternal life ; having the b love of God always in your hearts , that ye may be lifted up at the last day and enter into his c rest .\\n30 And may the Lord grant unto you repentance , that ye may not bring down his wrath upon you , that ye may not be a bound down by the chains of b hell , that ye may not suffer the second c death .\\n31 And Alma spake many more words unto the people , which are not written in a this book .\\nrevelation given through Joseph Smith , at Manchester , New York , March 1830 .

and that you b confess your sins , lest you suffer these c punishments of which I have spoken , of which in the smallest , yea , even in the least degree you have d tasted at the time I withdrew my Spirit .\\n21 And I command you that you a preach naught but repentance , and show b not these things unto the world until it is wisdom in me .\\n22 For they cannot a bear meat now , but b milk they must receive ;

yea , before the world as well as in secret , in public as well as in private .\\n29 And thou shalt a declare glad tidings , yea , b publish it upon the mountains , and upon every high place , and among every people that thou shalt be permitted to see .\\n30 And thou shalt do it with all humility , a trusting in me , b reviling not against revilers .\\n31 And of a tenets thou shalt not talk , but thou shalt declare repentance and b faith on the Savior , and c remission of sins by d baptism , and by e fire , yea , even the f Holy Ghost .\\n32 Behold , this is a great and the last a commandment which I shall give unto you concerning this matter ;

HC 1 : 128 @-@ 131 .\\nat this time the Prophet was engaged almost daily in making a translation of the Bible .\\nthe translation was begun as early as June 1830 , and both Oliver Cowdery and John Whitmer had served as scribes .\\nsince they had now been called to other duties , Sidney Rigdon was called by divine appointment to serve as the Prophet &apos;s scribe in this work ( verse 20 ) .\\nas a preface to his record of this revelation the Prophet wrote : &quot; in December Sidney Rigdon came &#91; from Ohio &#93; to inquire of the Lord , and with him came Edward Partridge . .\\n1 Listen to the voice of the a Lord your God , even b Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end , whose c course is one d eternal round , the e same today as yesterday , and forever .\\n2 I am Jesus Christ , the Son of God , who was a crucified for the sins of the world , even as many as will b believe on my name , that they may become the c sons of God , even d one in e me as I am f one in the Father , as the Father is one in me , that we may be one .\\n3 Behold , verily , verily , I say unto my servant Sidney , I have looked upon thee and thy works .\\nI have a heard thy prayers , and prepared thee for a greater work .\\n4 Thou art blessed , for thou shalt do great things .\\nbehold thou wast sent forth , even as a John , to prepare the way before me , and before b Elijah which should come , and thou knewest it not .\\n6 But now I give unto thee a commandment , that thou shalt a baptize by water , and they shall receive the b Holy Ghost by the laying on of the c hands , even as the apostles of old .\\n7 And it shall come to pass that there shall be a great work in the land , even among the a Gentiles , for their b folly and their abominations shall be made manifest in the eyes of all people .\\n8 For I am God , and mine arm is not a shortened ; and I will show b miracles , c signs , and wonders , unto all those who d believe on my name .\\n9 And whoso shall ask it in my name in a faith , they shall b cast out c devils ; they shall heal the d sick ; they shall cause the blind to receive their e sight , and the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak , and the lame to walk .\\n11 But a without faith shall not anything be shown forth except b desolations upon c Babylon , the same which has made d all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her e fornication .\\n12 And there are a none that doeth good except those who are ready to b receive the fulness of my gospel , which I have sent forth unto this generation .\\n14 And their arm shall be my arm , and I will be their a shield and their buckler ; and I will gird up their loins , and they shall fight manfully for me ; and their b enemies shall be under their feet ; and I will let c fall the d sword in their behalf , and by the e fire of mine indignation will I preserve them .\\n16 And they shall learn the parable of the a fig -tree , for even now already summer is nigh .\\n18 And I have given unto him the a keys of the mystery of those things which have been b sealed , even things which were from the c foundation of the world , and the things which shall come from this time until the time of my coming , if he d abide in me , and if not , e another will I plant in his stead .\\n19 Wherefore , watch over him that his faith fail not , and it shall be given by the a Comforter , the b Holy Ghost , that knoweth all things .\\n21 For they will hear my a voice , and shall b see me , and shall not be c asleep , and shall d abide the day of my e coming ; for they shall be f purified , even as I am pure .\\n22 And now I say unto you , a tarry with him , and he shall journey with you ; forsake him not , and surely these things shall be fulfilled .\\n23 And a inasmuch as ye do not write , behold , it shall be b given unto him to prophesy ; and thou shalt preach my gospel and call on c the holy prophets to prove his words , as they shall be given him .\\n25 And a Israel shall be b saved in mine own due time ; and by the c keys which I have given shall they be led , and no more be confounded at all .\\n26 a Lift up your hearts and be glad , your b redemption draweth nigh .\\n27 Fear not , little a flock , the b kingdom is yours until I come .\\nrevelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet , on the bank of the Missouri River , McIlwaine &apos;s Bend , August 12 , 1831 .

QuarkXPress 8 is considered by many to have the best integration with Photoshop &apos;s PSD file format of any layout tool available today . in this section we &apos;ll explain when you should use the PSD format for your images and how to get the most out of them . for example , you may have multiple layers in your PSD with different product shots , which will vary from publication to publication . if you use PSD , you can switch those layers on or off in QuarkXPress without having to save a separate TIFF for each publication . another question that might tip you in favor of PSD is , &quot; Do I need to use a spot color with this image ? &quot; using spot colors in most image formats is often complicated . however , because of the way QuarkXPress supports PSD channels , it &apos;s simpler and more flexible . bringing the PSD files into QuarkXPress is the same as any other image . create a Box and then use File &gt; Import ... or simply drag and drop the image from your desktop , Finder or an application like Adobe Bridge ® with or without creating a box first . to access the special features of PSD , open the PSD Import palette . ( window &gt; PSD Import ) You &apos;ll instantly see thumbnails of the layers along with their names . for example , you &apos;ve created a layer in Photoshop to give your image an antiqued look , but when you put it in your layout it seems swamped by the surrounding colors . one option might be to reduce the opacity of that layer by clicking on it and entering a new opacity level . if you want to add an extra ink or plate to your images , you can set up a channel to do that in Photoshop . for example , maybe you intend to varnish part of an image , or you want to use a spot color within your image . QuarkXPress can re \\xad map any channel right in the PSD Import palette - non \\xad destructively . so click on the channels divider of the PSD Import Palette ; double click on the channel in question , and you can pick any color from your project &apos;s color palette , ensuring consistency . as powerful as the PSD support of QuarkXPress 8 is , it can &apos;t manipulate certain kinds of layers , such as layer effects &#91; e.g. if you use one of these layers , the image will import and print just fine , but you won &apos;t get access to the layer controls of the PSD Import palette . if you need that functionality , you can eliminate those kinds of layers from your PSD by converting the layer effects to stand @-@ alone layers or &apos; smart objects &apos; &#91; right click on the Layer in the Photoshop layers palette &#93; . QuarkXPress supports text layers , most adjustment layers , and even 3D layers including opacity and blending mode controls . Illustrator is a great tool for creating logos and vector illustrations . traditionally , the route into QuarkXPress has been to export an EPS from Illustrator . now , things are made much easier with the arrival of direct Illustrator .ai file import into QuarkXPress 8 . simply drag and drop or import your Illustrator native file into your layout just as you would any graphics file format . QuarkXPress has a powerful transparency engine , but it doesn &apos;t support partially transparent objects in PDF or .ai files yet . so if you are using something like a drop shadow in Illustrator and plan to place that over a non @-@ white background or object , you might see undesirable results . the good news is that the drop shadow and transparency features of QuarkXPress works on imported Illustrator files , so you can apply a drop shadow or change the opacity of your .ai file right in your layout instead . QuarkXPress is well equipped for drawing tasks and in our newest release we have standardised many of our graphics tools to work more like Illustrator , Freehand and similar tools . watch a video on how to create compelling illustrations in QuarkXPress 8 . page @-@ layout professionals can create rich Flash projects - without compromising design - using the built @-@ in Flash authoring capabilities included in every edition of QuarkXPress 8 . working in the same familiar print environment of QuarkXPress 8 , you can take existing print jobs to Flash , or create new Flash projects , in minutes - no additional purchase or coding required ! watch a video on how to create sophisticated Flash designs in QuarkXPress 8 . * InDesign CS 4 : interactive elements such as hyperlinks , page transitions , and button actions are not included in the XFL file . disclaimer : this document is based on publicly available information and not based on hands @-@ on software evaluation . its content may be revised at any time .

Gareth and me were invited to have lunch with him in Soho in central London , and went there with the objective of learning everything we could about the &quot; enemy . &quot; this proved to be pretty naive , since Gilad is much too nice to be called an &quot; enemy . &quot; but there we were : a Swede , a South African and an Israeli , all with very different professional background and life stories , talking about the future of families online from very different perspectives . I didn &apos;t expect this , but we found that we had much in common . we shared the same ideas and vision for what we wanted to achieve with our businesses , even though our approach was far from similar . Kindo had set out to build a site that would help you interact with the family that is around you here and now . we were trying to come up with tools to help you share information and communicate with the people that matter most to you right now . MyHeritage on the other hand had developed amazing technologies to help you find out everything about your family &apos;s history , and had spent years perfecting these technologies . ultimately though , what interested us both was the opportunity to help families discover more about who they are and their past , and use the web to bring them closer together . as Gareth and I travelled back on the tube , we talked about how nice it would be to be able to offer our own users the same tools as MyHeritage already had . what really got us excited was their SmartMatching Technology , which matches people in your family tree with 250 Million other names , and suggests who you might be related too . during this summer , we &apos;ve been thinking long and hard about the future of Kindo , and what the best option would be for taking Kindo to the next level . the more time we spent with Gilad as well as the rest of the team in Israel ( not to mention the very loud rooster that runs around in their campus ) , the more convinced we all became - we &apos;ll be better off together . so we join the MyHeritage family because we share the same vision and values ( as families should ) , and because we think that we can build an amazing product together - bringing real benefits to families around the world . this is what we &apos;re planning to do over the next years . as you see from the smiles in the picture below , this is a happy day for us here in the Putney Offices . this years Swedish Genealogy Days the yearly conference of the Swedish Federation of Genealogical Societies was held in the city of Malmö in the province of Skåne in southern Sweden . over 100 exibitors crowded in the convention center at Europaporten in Malmö . everything from genealogical societies , archives to companies offering original sources online . in the meanwhile , you can still work on your profiles and upload the photos from the weekend &apos;s family reunion . update : now everything is fixed ! it was the database acting a bit weird but Stephen has done a great job to fix it . everyone hits a brick wall in genealogy , where the birth and death records just aren &apos;t easy to find . in that case , try some different records . deeds often contain information on who sold what to whom ; who inherited what from whom ; or how some land was divided among a family . historic tax records on land also sometimes have interesting information , such as co @-@ ownership . just as the squirrels and different kinds of birds collect nuts and seeds , someone in the Kindo office seems to be doing some really solid forward planning . judging from this picture - it &apos;s going to be a looong winter . as I point out in my book , Genealogy Online 8th Edition , you can do a lot of good research using search engines and Boolean operators ( AND , NOT , OR , and parentheses . ) Recently , Yahoo ! advanced Google still accepts the most popular Boolean terms , and Exalead even supports the NEAR operator , which really helps with common surnames , but Live Search is now the only major search engine with full Boolean support . for more details on how to do the Boolean Boogie for genealogy , read Genealogy Online 8th Edition . most beginners to genealogy are fuzzy about cousinship . for example , while many understand first cousins are people with common grandparents , many folks confuse first cousin once removed and second cousin . then , there are families like mine : my mother &apos;s siblings were born from 1911 to 1932 . that means her youngest brother &quot; Mike &quot; went to school with the oldest sister &apos;s oldest child , his niece &quot; Karen . &quot; as it turned out , Uncle &quot; Mike &quot; and niece &quot; Karen &quot; married two people who were siblings , &quot; Michelle &quot; and &quot; Kevin , &quot; making their children both first cousins and first cousins once removed . showing degrees of relationship by blood . -first it does not replace paper documentation since it does not name common ancestors , it is more a tool to prove lineage . several companies , like Family Tree DNA , can assist you to confirm your family tree or allow you to determine whether two people are related if you give them DNA of someone . - It &apos;s less reffective for females to use DNA than for males because thanks to Y @-@ DNA , we can determine paternal and maternal lines , whereas for females it is just maternal . here are a few suggestions to get you started : introduction to Genealogy from National Genealogical Society ( U.S. ) Most genealogists take this course first . it is very American @-@ centric , but the techniques can be applied to any country &apos;s vital statistics . members of the National Genealogical Society ( NGS ) receive a tuition discount . family History Personal Enrichment Classes Learn from Brigham Young University about research in the United States , France and Germany . Lufthansa owes its origins to &quot; Deutsche Luft Hansa Aktiengesellschaft &quot; ( renamed &quot; Lufthansa &quot; in 1933 ) , which is formed from a merger between &quot; Deutsche Aero Lloyd &quot; ( DAL ) and &quot; Junkers Luftverkehr &quot; on January 6 . the new airline inherits its crane logo , designed by &quot; Deutsche Luft @-@ Reederei &quot; in 1919 , from DAL , the blue @-@ and @-@ yellow house colours from Junkers . it commences scheduled flights on April 6 with a fleet of 162 aircraft , of 18 different types . a flying expedition to China is the event of the year . following its acquisition of shares in 1926 in the German @-@ Russian &quot; Dereluft &quot; airline , which was founded in 1921 , Lufthansa is influential in the founding of the Spanish Iberia , the Brazilian &quot; Syndicato Condor &quot; and the Chinese &quot; Eurasia &quot; airlines . Lufthansa opens the first trans @-@ oceanic , scheduled airmail service across the South Atlantic . between 1936 and 1938 , it also experiments with scheduled air services across the North Atlantic . after substantial expansion of the route network in 1939 \\x97 including flights to Bangkok and Santiago de Chile \\x97 wartime air services , except for a few European countries , are suspended . all flights are discontinued in 1945 and Lufthansa goes into receivership and is finally wound up and struck from the Berlin commercial register in 1965 . the Federal Transport Minister sets up a working committee in 1951 to prepare for the resumption of air traffic in postwar Germany and entrusts the job of implementation to &quot; Büro Bongers , &quot; the office headed by Hans M. Bongers , the traffic chief of the old Lufthansa in Cologne . a new company to run air services and named &quot; Aktiengesellschaft für Luftverkehrsbedarf &quot; ( Luftag ) is founded in Cologne on January 6 , 1953 . Lufthansa enters the jet age , initially on long @-@ haul routes , with the arrival in the fleet of the Boeing 707 . the last of the propeller @-@ driven aircraft , a Vickers Viscount , is retired in 1971 . conversion to jet aircraft continues with the start of flights on medium @-@ haul routes with the Boeing 727 and , on short @-@ haul , with the Boeing 737 , the city jet largely fathered by Lufthansa . the wide @-@ body era begins at Lufthansa with the delivery of its first Boeing 747 jumbo jet in 1970 , later to be joined by the McDonnell @-@ Douglas DC10 and the A300 , the first of the jets from the newly founded European aircraftmaker . Lufthansa resumes flights to Berlin 45 years after the end of World War Two following Germany &apos;s reunification . Lufthansa masters its worst @-@ ever economic crisis with a sweeping rehabilitation programme . the airline , largely owned by the state , is privatised step by step . its MRO , cargo and IT businesses are spun off as independent companies . Lufthansa , Air Canada , SAS , Thai Airways und United Airlines create the &quot; Star Alliance , &quot; the world &apos;s first multilateral airline grouping , later to be joined by other carriers . the Lufthansa Aviation Group equips itself for the new millenium , training its focus on innovation and quality . placement of orders for 15 Airbus A380 megaliners charts the airline &apos;s path into the future . even during times of crisis in the aviation industry , Lufthansa remains on the ascent : with the &quot; Future European Operations &quot; programme , the airline reorganises its regional markets , while gaining new partner airlines to expand the Star Alliance global route network . passengers enjoy greater comfort in a completely revamped Business Class with fast broadband Internet connectivity in the aircraft cabin . Lufthansa creates new perspectives for Germany &apos;s future as a business location : Lufthansa orders 20 Boeing 747 @-@ 8s and is the launch customer for the aircraft . preparations for the A380 include route proving with Airbus , a new A380 maintenance hangar and a new terminal area in Frankfurt . the Lufthansa Aviation Center becomes an architectural flagship .

Lehi prophesies of a land of liberty - His seed shall be scattered and smitten if they reject the Holy One of Israel - He exhorts his sons to put on the armor of righteousness . 1 And now it came to pass that after I , Nephi , had made an end of teaching my brethren , our a father , Lehi , also spake many things unto them , and rehearsed unto them , how great things the Lord had done for them in bringing them out of the land of Jerusalem . 2 And he spake unto them concerning their a rebellions upon the waters , and the mercies of God in sparing their lives , that they were not swallowed up in the sea . 3 And he also spake unto them concerning the land of promise , which they had obtained - how a merciful the Lord had been in b warning us that we should flee out of the land of Jerusalem . 4 For , behold , said he , I have a seen a b vision , in which I know that c Jerusalem is d destroyed ; and had we remained in Jerusalem we should also have e perished . 5 But , said he , notwithstanding our afflictions , we have obtained a a land of promise , a land which is b choice above all other lands ; a land which the Lord God hath c covenanted with me should be a land for the inheritance of my seed . yea , the Lord hath d covenanted this land unto me , and to my children forever , and also all those who should be e led out of other countries by the hand of the Lord . 6 Wherefore , I , Lehi , prophesy according to the workings of the Spirit which is in me , that there shall a none come into this land save they shall be brought by the hand of the Lord . 7 Wherefore , this a land is consecrated unto him whom he shall bring . and if it so be that they shall serve him according to the commandments which he hath given , it shall be a land of b liberty unto them ; wherefore , they shall never be brought down into captivity ; if so , it shall be because of iniquity ; for if iniquity shall abound c cursed shall be the land for their sakes , but unto the righteous it shall be blessed forever . 8 And behold , it is wisdom that this land should be a kept as yet from the knowledge of other b nations ; for behold , many nations would overrun the land , that there would be no place for an inheritance . 9 Wherefore , I , Lehi , have obtained a a promise , that b inasmuch as those whom the Lord God shall bring out of the land of Jerusalem shall keep his commandments , they shall c prosper upon the face of this land ; and they shall be kept from all other nations , that they may possess this land unto themselves . and if it so be that they shall d keep his commandments they shall be blessed upon the face of this land , and there shall be none to molest them , nor to take away the land of their e inheritance ; and they shall dwell safely forever . 11 Yea , he will bring a other nations unto them , and he will give unto them power , and he will take away from them the lands of their possessions , and he will cause them to be b scattered and smitten . 12 Yea , as one generation passeth to another there shall be a bloodsheds , and great visitations among them ; wherefore , my sons , I would that ye would remember ; yea , I would that ye would hearken unto my words . 13 O that ye would awake ; awake from a deep a sleep , yea , even from the sleep of b hell , and shake off the awful c chains by which ye are bound , which are the chains which bind the children of men , that they are carried away captive down to the eternal d gulf of misery and woe . and arise from the dust , and hear the words of a trembling a parent , whose limbs ye must soon lay down in the cold and silent b grave , from whence no traveler can c return ; a few more d days and I go the e way of all the earth . 15 But behold , the Lord hath a redeemed my soul from hell ; I have beheld his b glory , and I am encircled about eternally in the c arms of his d love . 16 And I desire that ye should remember to observe the a statutes and the judgments of the Lord ; behold , this hath been the anxiety of my soul from the beginning . 18 Or , that a a cursing should come upon you for the space of b many generations ; and ye are visited by sword , and by famine , and are hated , and are led according to the will and captivity of the c devil . 19 O my sons , that these things might not come upon you , but that ye might be a choice and a a favored people of the Lord . but behold , his will be done ; for his b ways are righteousness forever . 20 And he hath said that : a Inasmuch as ye shall keep my b commandments ye shall c prosper in the land ; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence . 22 That ye may not be a cursed with a sore cursing ; and also , that ye may not incur the displeasure of a b just God upon you , unto the destruction , yea , the eternal destruction of both soul and body . 23 Awake , my sons ; put on the armor of a righteousness . shake off the b chains with which ye are bound , and come forth out of obscurity , and arise from the dust . 25 And I exceedingly fear and tremble because of you , lest he shall suffer again ; for behold , ye have a accused him that he sought power and b authority over you ; but I know that he hath not sought for power nor authority over you , but he hath sought the glory of God , and your own eternal welfare . 26 And ye have murmured because he hath been plain unto you . ye say that he hath used a sharpness ; ye say that he hath been angry with you ; but behold , his b sharpness was the sharpness of the power of the word of God , which was in him ; and that which ye call anger was the truth , according to that which is in God , which he could not restrain , manifesting boldly concerning your iniquities . 27 And it must needs be that the a power of God must be with him , even unto his commanding you that ye must obey . but behold , it was not he , but it was the b Spirit of the Lord which was in him , which c opened his mouth to utterance that he could not shut it . 28 And now my son , Laman , and also Lemuel and Sam , and also my sons who are the sons of Ishmael , behold , if ye will hearken unto the voice of Nephi ye shall not perish . and if ye will hearken unto him I leave unto you a a blessing , yea , even my first blessing . 29 But if ye will not hearken unto him I take away my a first blessing , yea , even my blessing , and it shall rest upon him . 30 And now , Zoram , I speak unto you : behold , thou art the a servant of Laban ; nevertheless , thou hast been brought out of the land of Jerusalem , and I know that thou art a true b friend unto my son , Nephi , forever . 31 Wherefore , because thou hast been faithful thy seed shall be blessed a with his seed , that they dwell in prosperity long upon the face of this land ; and nothing , save it shall be iniquity among them , shall harm or disturb their prosperity upon the face of this land forever . 32 Wherefore , if ye shall keep the commandments of the Lord , the Lord hath consecrated this land for the security of thy seed with the seed of my son . redemption cometh through the Holy Messiah - Freedom of choice ( agency ) is essential to existence and progression - Adam fell that men might be - Men are free to choose liberty and eternal life . 1 And now , Jacob , I speak unto you : thou art my a first -born in the days of my tribulation in the wilderness . and behold , in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow , because of the rudeness of thy brethren . 2 Nevertheless , Jacob , my first @-@ born in the wilderness , thou knowest the greatness of God ; and he shall consecrate thine a afflictions for thy gain . 3 Wherefore , thy soul shall be blessed , and thou shalt dwell safely with thy brother , Nephi ; and thy days shall be a spent in the service of thy God . Wherefore , I know that thou art redeemed , because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer ; for thou hast b beheld that in the c fulness of time he cometh to bring salvation unto men . 4 And thou hast a beheld in thy youth his glory ; wherefore , thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh ; for the Spirit is the same , yesterday , today , and forever . and the way is prepared from the fall of man , and b salvation is c free . 5 And men are instructed sufficiently that they a know good from evil . and the b law is given unto men . and by the law no flesh is c justified ; or , by the law men are d cut off . yea , by the temporal law they were cut off ; and also , by the spiritual law they perish from that which is good , and become miserable forever . 6 Wherefore , a redemption cometh in and through the b Holy c Messiah ; for he is full of d grace and truth . 7 Behold , he offereth himself a a sacrifice for sin , to answer the ends of the law , unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit ; and unto b none else can the c ends of the law be answered . 9 Wherefore , he is the firstfruits unto God , inasmuch as he shall make a intercession for all the children of men ; and they that believe in him shall be saved . 10 And because of the intercession for a all , all men come unto God ; wherefore , they stand in the presence of him , to be b judged of him according to the truth and c holiness which is in him . 11 For it must needs be , that there is an a opposition in all things . if not so , my first @-@ born in the wilderness , righteousness could not be brought to pass , neither wickedness , neither holiness nor misery , neither good nor bad . Wherefore , all things must needs be a compound in one ; wherefore , if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead , having no life neither death , nor corruption nor incorruption , happiness nor misery , neither sense nor insensibility . 12 Wherefore , it must needs have been created for a thing of naught ; wherefore there would have been no a purpose in the end of its creation . Wherefore , this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes , and also the power , and the mercy , and the b justice of God . 13 And if ye shall say there is a no law , ye shall also say there is no sin . if ye shall say there is no sin , ye shall also say there is no righteousness . and if there be no righteousness there be no happiness . and if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery . and if these things are not b there is no God . and if there is no God we are not , neither the earth ; for there could have been no creation of things , neither to act nor to be acted upon ; wherefore , all things must have vanished away . 14 And now , my sons , I speak unto you these things for your profit and a learning ; for there is a God , and he hath b created all things , both the heavens and the earth , and all things that in them are , both things to act and things to be c acted upon . 16 Wherefore , the Lord God gave unto man that he should a act for himself . Wherefore , man could not b act for himself save it should be that he was c enticed by the one or the other . 17 And I , Lehi , according to the things which I have read , must needs suppose that an a angel of God , according to that which is written , had b fallen from heaven ; wherefore , he became a c devil , having sought that which was evil before God . 18 And because he had fallen from heaven , and had become miserable forever , he a sought also the misery of all mankind . Wherefore , he said unto Eve , yea , even that old serpent , who is the devil , who is the father of all b lies , wherefore he said : partake of the forbidden fruit , and ye shall not die , but ye shall be as God , c knowing good and evil . 19 And after Adam and Eve had a partaken of the forbidden fruit they were driven out of the garden of b Eden , to till the earth . 20 And they have brought forth children ; yea , even the a family of all the earth . 21 And the days of the children of a men were prolonged , according to the b will of God , that they might c repent while in the flesh ; wherefore , their state became a state of d probation , and their time was lengthened , according to the commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men . for he gave commandment that all men must repent ; for he showed unto all men that they were e lost , because of the transgression of their parents . 22 And now , behold , if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen , but he would have remained in the garden of Eden . and all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created ; and they must have remained forever , and had no end . 23 And they would have had no a children ; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence , having no b joy , for they knew no misery ; doing no good , for they knew no c sin . 24 But behold , all things have been done in the wisdom of him who a knoweth all things . 25 a Adam b fell that men might be ; and men c are , that they might have d joy . 26 And the a Messiah cometh in the fulness of time , that he may b redeem the children of men from the fall . and because that they are c redeemed from the fall they have become d free forever , knowing good from evil ; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon , save it be by the punishment of the e law at the great and last day , according to the commandments which God hath given . 27 Wherefore , men are a free according to the b flesh ; and c all things are d given them which are expedient unto man . and they are free to e choose f liberty and eternal g life , through the great Mediator of all men , or to choose captivity and death , according to the captivity and power of the devil ; for he seeketh that all men might be h miserable like unto himself . 29 And not choose eternal death , according to the will of the flesh and the a evil which is therein , which giveth the spirit of the devil power to b captivate , to bring you down to c hell , that he may reign over you in his own kingdom . 30 I have spoken these few words unto you all , my sons , in the last days of my probation ; and I have chosen the good part , according to the words of the prophet . and I have none other object save it be the everlasting a welfare of your souls . the Gods finish their planning of the creation of all things - They bring to pass the creation according to their plans - Adam names every living creature . 1 And thus we will finish the heavens and the earth , and all the a hosts of them . 2 And the Gods said among themselves : on the seventh time we will end our work , which we have counseled ; and we will a rest on the b seventh time from all our work which we have counseled . 3 And the Gods concluded upon the seventh time , because that on the seventh time they would a rest from all their b works which they ( the Gods ) counseled among themselves to form ; and c sanctified it . and thus were their decisions at the time that they counseled among themselves to form the heavens and the earth . 5 According to all that which they had said concerning every plant of the field before it was in the a earth , and every herb of the field before it grew ; for the Gods had not caused it to rain upon the earth when they counseled to do them , and had not formed a man to till the ground . 6 But there went up a mist from the earth , and watered the whole face of the ground . 7 And the a Gods formed man from the b dust of the ground , and took his c spirit ( that is , the man &apos;s spirit ) , and put it into him ; and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life , and man became a living d soul . 8 And the Gods planted a garden , eastward in a Eden , and there they put the man , whose spirit they had put into the body which they had formed . 9 And out of the ground made the Gods to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food ; the a tree of life , also , in the midst of the garden , and the tree of knowledge of good and evil . 10 There was a river running out of Eden , to water the garden , and from thence it was parted and became into four heads . 11 And the Gods took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden , to dress it and to keep it . 13 But of the tree of knowledge of good and evil , thou shalt not eat of it ; for in the time that thou eatest thereof , thou shalt surely die . now I , Abraham , saw that it was after the Lord &apos;s a time , which was after the time of b Kolob ; for as yet the Gods had not appointed unto Adam his reckoning . 14 And the Gods said : let us make an help meet for the man , for it is not good that the man should be alone , therefore we will form an help meet for him . 16 And of the rib which the Gods had taken from man , formed they a a woman , and brought her unto the man . 18 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother , and shall a cleave unto his wife , and they shall be b one flesh . 19 And they were both naked , the man and his wife , and were not a ashamed . 20 And out of the ground the Gods formed every beast of the field , and every fowl of the air , and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them ; and whatsoever a Adam called every living creature , that should be the name thereof . 21 And Adam gave a names to all b cattle , to the fowl of the air , to every beast of the field ; and for Adam , there was found an c help meet for him . men are called as high priests because of their exceeding faith and good works - They are to teach the commandments - Through righteousness they are sanctified and enter into the rest of the Lord - Melchizedek was one of these - Angels are declaring glad tidings throughout the land - They will reveal the actual coming of Christ . 1 And again , my brethren , I would cite your minds forward to the time when the Lord God gave these commandments unto his children ; and I would that ye should remember that the Lord God a ordained priests , after his holy order , which was after the order of his Son , to teach these things unto the people . 2 And those priests were ordained after the a order of his Son , in a b manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for redemption . 4 And thus they have been a called to this holy calling on account of their faith , while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and b blindness of their minds , while , if it had not been for this they might have had as great c privilege as their brethren . 9 Thus they become a high priests forever , after the order of the Son , the Only Begotten of the Father , who is without beginning of days or end of years , who is full of b grace , equity , and truth . 11 Therefore they were called after this holy order , and were a sanctified , and their b garments were washed white through the blood of the Lamb . 12 Now they , after being a sanctified by the b Holy Ghost , having their garments made white , being c pure and spotless before God , could not look upon d sin save it were with e abhorrence ; and there were many , exceedingly great many , who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God . 13 And now , my brethren , I would that ye should humble yourselves before God , and bring forth a fruit meet for repentance , that ye may also enter into that rest . 14 Yea , humble yourselves even as the people in the days of a Melchizedek , who was also a high priest after this same order which I have spoken , who also took upon him the high priesthood forever . 15 And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid a tithes ; yea , even our father Abraham paid tithes of one @-@ tenth part of all he possessed . 16 Now these a ordinances were given after this b manner , that thereby the people might look forward on the Son of God , it being a c type of his order , or it being his order , and this that they might look forward to him for a remission of their sins , that they might enter into the rest of the Lord . 18 But Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith , and received the office of the high priesthood according to the a holy order of God , did preach repentance unto his people . and behold , they did repent ; and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his days ; therefore he was called the prince of peace , for he was the king of Salem ; and he did reign under his father . 19 Now , there were a many before him , and also there were many afterwards , but b none were greater ; therefore , of him they have more particularly made mention . 20 Now I need not rehearse the matter ; what I have said may suffice . behold , the a scriptures are before you ; if ye will b wrest them it shall be to your own destruction . 22 Yea , and the voice of the Lord , by the a mouth of angels , doth declare it unto all nations ; yea , doth declare it , that they may have glad tidings of great joy ; yea , and he doth sound these glad tidings among all his people , yea , even to them that are scattered abroad upon the face of the earth ; wherefore they have come unto us . 23 And they are made known unto us in a plain terms , that we may understand , that we cannot err ; and this because of our being b wanderers in a strange land ; therefore , we are thus highly favored , for we have these glad tidings declared unto us in all parts of our vineyard . 24 For behold , a angels are declaring it unto many at this time in our land ; and this is for the purpose of preparing the hearts of the children of men to receive his word at the time of his coming in his glory . 25 And now we only wait to hear the joyful news declared unto us by the mouth of angels , of his coming ; for the time cometh , we a know not how soon . would to God that it might be in my day ; but let it be sooner or later , in it I will rejoice . 26 And it shall be made known unto a just and holy men , by the mouth of angels , at the time of his coming , that the words of our fathers may be fulfilled , according to that which they have spoken concerning him , which was according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them . 29 a Having faith on the Lord ; having a hope that ye shall receive eternal life ; having the b love of God always in your hearts , that ye may be lifted up at the last day and enter into his c rest . 30 And may the Lord grant unto you repentance , that ye may not bring down his wrath upon you , that ye may not be a bound down by the chains of b hell , that ye may not suffer the second c death . 31 And Alma spake many more words unto the people , which are not written in a this book . revelation given through Joseph Smith , at Manchester , New York , March 1830 .

40 Or canst thou run about longer as a a blind guide ? 41 Or canst thou be a humble and meek , and conduct thyself wisely before me ? revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet and Sidney Rigdon , at or near Fayette , New York , December 1830 . HC 1 : 128 @-@ 131 . at this time the Prophet was engaged almost daily in making a translation of the Bible . the translation was begun as early as June 1830 , and both Oliver Cowdery and John Whitmer had served as scribes . since they had now been called to other duties , Sidney Rigdon was called by divine appointment to serve as the Prophet &apos;s scribe in this work ( verse 20 ) . as a preface to his record of this revelation the Prophet wrote : &quot; in December Sidney Rigdon came &#91; from Ohio &#93; to inquire of the Lord , and with him came Edward Partridge . . 1 Listen to the voice of the a Lord your God , even b Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end , whose c course is one d eternal round , the e same today as yesterday , and forever . 2 I am Jesus Christ , the Son of God , who was a crucified for the sins of the world , even as many as will b believe on my name , that they may become the c sons of God , even d one in e me as I am f one in the Father , as the Father is one in me , that we may be one . 3 Behold , verily , verily , I say unto my servant Sidney , I have looked upon thee and thy works . I have a heard thy prayers , and prepared thee for a greater work . 4 Thou art blessed , for thou shalt do great things . behold thou wast sent forth , even as a John , to prepare the way before me , and before b Elijah which should come , and thou knewest it not . 6 But now I give unto thee a commandment , that thou shalt a baptize by water , and they shall receive the b Holy Ghost by the laying on of the c hands , even as the apostles of old . 7 And it shall come to pass that there shall be a great work in the land , even among the a Gentiles , for their b folly and their abominations shall be made manifest in the eyes of all people . 8 For I am God , and mine arm is not a shortened ; and I will show b miracles , c signs , and wonders , unto all those who d believe on my name . 9 And whoso shall ask it in my name in a faith , they shall b cast out c devils ; they shall heal the d sick ; they shall cause the blind to receive their e sight , and the deaf to hear , and the dumb to speak , and the lame to walk . 11 But a without faith shall not anything be shown forth except b desolations upon c Babylon , the same which has made d all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her e fornication . 12 And there are a none that doeth good except those who are ready to b receive the fulness of my gospel , which I have sent forth unto this generation . 14 And their arm shall be my arm , and I will be their a shield and their buckler ; and I will gird up their loins , and they shall fight manfully for me ; and their b enemies shall be under their feet ; and I will let c fall the d sword in their behalf , and by the e fire of mine indignation will I preserve them . 16 And they shall learn the parable of the a fig -tree , for even now already summer is nigh . 18 And I have given unto him the a keys of the mystery of those things which have been b sealed , even things which were from the c foundation of the world , and the things which shall come from this time until the time of my coming , if he d abide in me , and if not , e another will I plant in his stead . 19 Wherefore , watch over him that his faith fail not , and it shall be given by the a Comforter , the b Holy Ghost , that knoweth all things . 21 For they will hear my a voice , and shall b see me , and shall not be c asleep , and shall d abide the day of my e coming ; for they shall be f purified , even as I am pure . 22 And now I say unto you , a tarry with him , and he shall journey with you ; forsake him not , and surely these things shall be fulfilled . 23 And a inasmuch as ye do not write , behold , it shall be b given unto him to prophesy ; and thou shalt preach my gospel and call on c the holy prophets to prove his words , as they shall be given him . 25 And a Israel shall be b saved in mine own due time ; and by the c keys which I have given shall they be led , and no more be confounded at all . 26 a Lift up your hearts and be glad , your b redemption draweth nigh . 27 Fear not , little a flock , the b kingdom is yours until I come . revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet , on the bank of the Missouri River , McIlwaine &apos;s Bend , August 12 , 1831 . HC 1 : 202 @-@ 205 . on their return trip to Kirtland the Prophet and ten elders had traveled down the Missouri River in canoes . on the third day of the journey many dangers were experienced . elder William W. Phelps , in daylight vision , saw the destroyer riding in power upon the face of the waters . 1 @-@ 12 , The Lord has decreed many destructions upon the waters ; 13 @-@ 22 , The waters were cursed by John , and the destroyer rideth upon their face ; 23 @-@ 29 , Some have power to command the waters ; 30 @-@ 35 , Elders are to journey two by two and preach the gospel ; 36 @-@ 39 , They are to prepare for the coming of the Son of Man . 1 Behold , and hearken unto the voice of him who has all a power , who is from everlasting to everlasting , even b Alpha and Omega , the beginning and the end . 3 But verily I say unto you , that it is not needful for this whole company of mine elders to be moving swiftly upon the waters , whilst the inhabitants on either side are perishing in unbelief . 5 For I , the Lord , have decreed in mine anger many destructions upon the waters ; yea , and especially upon these waters . 6 Nevertheless , all flesh is in mine hand , and he that is faithful among you shall not a perish by the waters . 7 Wherefore , it is expedient that my servant Sidney Gilbert and my servant a William W. Phelps be in haste upon their errand and mission . 9 But now , verily I say , it behooveth me that ye should part . 10 And inasmuch as they are a faithful they shall be preserved , and I , the Lord , will be b with them . 11 And let the residue take that which is needful for clothing . 12 Let my servant Sidney Gilbert take that which is not needful with him , as you shall agree . 13 And now , behold , for your a good I gave unto you a b commandment concerning these things ; and I , the Lord , will reason with you as with men in days of old . 14 Behold , I , the Lord , in the beginning blessed the a waters ; but in the last days , by the mouth of my servant John , I b cursed the waters . 15 Wherefore , the days will come that no flesh shall be safe upon the waters . 16 And it shall be said in days to come that none is able to go up to the land of Zion upon the waters , but he that is upright in heart . 17 And , as I , the Lord , in the beginning a cursed the land , even so in the last days have I b blessed it , in its time , for the use of my saints , that they may partake the fatness thereof .
